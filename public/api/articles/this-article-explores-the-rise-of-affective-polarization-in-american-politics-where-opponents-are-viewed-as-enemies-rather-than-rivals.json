  "excerpt": "This article explores the rise of \"affective polarization\" in American politics, where opponents are viewed as enemies rather than rivals. This shift is driven by the ideological sorting of political parties and a media landscape that profits from outrage. The consequences include increased support for political violence, deep social division, and an erosion of trust in democratic institutions, a phenomenon the article notes is uniquely severe in the United States compared to other Western democracies.",
  "content": "In 1996, accepting the Republican presidential nomination, Senator Bob Dole drew a line. Speaking of his rival, President Bill Clinton, he said:\n\n> \"He is my opponent, not my enemy\"1.\n\nToday, that kind of distinction, which used to be a basic part of American democracy, now feels outdated and almost forgotten.\n\nThe way we talk about politics has changed. Instead of just disagreeing, many now see the other side as a *real threat*. This shift is not by chance. It comes from a cycle fueled by people with certain goals, divided media, and strong group loyalty.\n\nFor example, during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, targeted misinformation on social media aimed to increase division and strengthen partisan support. (Allcott et al., 2017) News coverage also often highlights conflict instead of agreement, like the divided reporting on healthcare reforms, which makes opposing views even more set. (He et al., 2021)\n\nThis process is known as *affective polarization*. It puts pressure on democratic values and makes political competition even tougher.\n\n## The Hydra of Hate\n\nTo understand the crisis, we must first diagnose it correctly. The problem isn't just that the two parties disagree on policy. That's *ideological polarization*, and while it has created legislative gridlock, it's a manageable feature of a healthy democracy that offers voters clear choices7777.\n\nThe bigger issue is *affective polarization*, which is when people feel strong, negative emotions toward those on the other side. Opponents are often seen not just as wrong, but as *dishonest*, *immoral*, *unintelligent*, or even *dangerous* to the country.\n\nAccording to the American National Election Studies, since the 1980s, Americans have rated their own party at about 70 out of 100, but their ratings for the other party have dropped from around 50 to below 20. (American National Election Studies, n.d.) This move from policy debates to seeing the other party as the enemy is a big reason for today’s problems.\n\n## The Division Machine: How It Works\n\nThis kind of hostility didn’t just happen on its own. Over the past 50 years, a system has developed that encourages and increases division. (Shapiro et al., 2020)\n\n### The \"Great Sorting\"\n\nFor decades, the two parties were ideologically messy. The Democratic Party housed both northern liberals and segregationist southerners, while the GOP had its own liberal wing 14. (Dixiecrat, n.d.) This forced compromise15.\n\nAfter the Civil Rights Act of the 1960s, the parties started to separate more clearly. After the Civil Rights Act of the 1960s, the two parties became more clearly divided. Many conservative white southerners moved to the GOP. (Movement conservatism, n.d.)\n\nBy the 1990s, talk of a *'culture war'* made politics seem like a battle over the country's core values. (Hunter & Davison, 1991)\n\nToday, the party someone supports often aligns with factors like race, religion, and where they live. As a result, party identity feels more important, and criticizing a party can feel like *criticizing someone’s whole way of life*.\n\n### The Outrage-for-Profit Model\n\nThis kind of tribal conflict is turned into profit by a divided media landscape.\n\nCable news channels like Fox News and MSNBC make money by catering to their viewers’ beliefs, creating information bubbles in which each side hears different facts. (Broockman et al., 2023)\n\nOn social media, algorithms that focus on engagement tend to spread the most *emotional, negative, and extreme content*, which encourages more polarizing talk. (Piccardi et al., 2024)\n\nThis can cause *'false polarization,'* where people believe the other side is more extreme than it actually is. (False polarization: Cognitive mechanisms and potential solutions, 2021) This misunderstanding creates more tension and keeps the conflict going.\n\nTo help fix this, try looking for news from different sources to get a range of views. Talking with people who see things differently can also help clear up misunderstandings and build understanding.\n\n## The American Anomaly\n\nThis kind of deep division is not common in other countries; it is mostly seen in the U.S.\n\nA multi-national study tracking polarization since the 1970s found the U.S. to be a *severe outlier*. While the U.S. gap in party \"feeling thermometer\" scores increased by nearly 19 points (from about 27 to 46), countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and Sweden saw decreases or little change in such measurements. (Shapiro et al., 2020)\n\nOther democracies have systems that help reduce conflict. Many have several parties and use parliamentary systems that encourage working together. In contrast, the U.S. has just two main parties and a winner-take-all system, which makes competition even stronger.\n\nAlso, the way party primaries work in the U.S. rewards candidates who appeal to the *most extreme voters*, not the general public. This pulls both parties even further apart. (Fouirnaies et al., 2017)\n\n## A Republic on the Brink\n\nThis situation has real consequences when politicians and citizens begin to see their opponents as *threats rather than competitors*.\n\n### From Rhetoric to Violence\n\nOne especially troubling tactic is dehumanization, which is when people use words like *'vermin,' 'infestation,'* or *'cancer'* to describe others. This language makes it easier to lose empathy and accept hostility.\n\nThe data confirms a chilling link. Studies show a direct correlation between high levels of affective polarization and greater individual support for political violence36. (Piazza & A., 2023)\n\nRecent events have demonstrated an increasing willingness to use force in political contexts. This includes the conspiracy to kidnap the governor of Michigan, a rise in threats against election workers, and the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\n### The Social Collapse\n\nThe heated nature of politics now affects how people interact, making many feel more distant from each other.\n\nIn 1960, a poll found that only 5% of Republicans and 4% of Democrats would be \"displeased\" if their child married someone from the other party. By the 2010s, this rose to about 49% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats—showing how political identity now shapes even our *most intimate relationships*. (Political polarization in the United States, n.d.)\n\nWhere people live also shapes Americans' politics, so there are fewer opportunities to meet others with different views. This makes it harder to feel empathy and can lead to misunderstandings. Many people end up feeling tired of politics because of this.\n\n### The Authoritarian Playbook\n\nAnother problem is that people start to lose trust in democratic institutions. When everything feels like a win-or-lose situation, groups like the press, courts, or civil service can be seen as enemies.\n\nThe election process can also be attacked. When false information spreads, as with claims about the 2020 election, people may start to doubt that elections are fair and look for other ways to achieve their goals.\n\nSome people involved in the Capitol attack thought they were protecting democracy. When democracy is seen as just *'my side winning,'* it becomes easier to justify actions that go against democratic values.\n\nNow, we face a big problem: people no longer share a basic understanding. To fix this, we need to see others as *opponents, not enemies*. One way to help is by having respectful conversations in our communities and social circles. Talking with understanding and respect can help close gaps. Getting involved in community engagement activities can also bring different groups together, build empathy, and reduce polarization. These steps let everyone help create a more peaceful and united society.",

    "special_report_content": "While today's political division feels unprecedented, the 'opponent vs. enemy' conflict is a recurring theme in American history. The nation’s very first decade under the Constitution, the 1790s, was rife with a level of partisan hatred that would shock modern sensibilities. Federalists and Democratic-Republicans didn't just disagree on policy; they saw each other as existential threats to the new republic. Partisan newspapers, funded by figures like Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson, slung vicious accusations, labeling opponents as dangerous French radicals or crypto-monarchists aiming to undo the revolution. This animosity culminated in the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, a set of laws used by the ruling Federalist party to imprison newspaper editors and politicians from the opposing party for criticizing the government—a clear case of treating political opposition as a crime.\n\nThe ultimate example of affective polarization leading to collapse occurred in the 1850s. The debate over slavery wasn't just a policy disagreement; it was a moral conflict that shattered the nation's social fabric. The rhetoric grew so dehumanizing that it famously spilled into physical violence within the halls of Congress itself. In 1856, Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina brutally beat Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts with a cane on the Senate floor for giving an anti-slavery speech. Far from being condemned by all, Brooks was hailed as a hero in the South, with constituents mailing him new canes to replace the one he broke. This event starkly illustrates how, when political opponents are viewed as immoral enemies, democratic norms crumble and violence becomes not only possible, but celebrated.",

In contrast, ratings for the opposing party have fallen sharply over the same period, from an average of 48 in 1980 to just 24 in 2020.\n\nClaim: Historically, the Democratic Party included both northern liberals and segregationist southerners, while the GOP had its own liberal wing.\nSource: https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-great-realignment-how-the-parties-switched-on-race/\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: Until the political realignments of the mid-to-late 20th century, the Democratic Party was a broad coalition that included both liberal urbanites in the North and staunchly segregationist 'Dixiecrats' in the South. Concurrently, the Republican Party had a significant moderate-to-liberal wing, personified by figures like Nelson Rockefeller, who supported civil rights and were often at odds with the party's more conservative faction.\n\nClaim: After the Civil Rights Act of the 1960s, many conservative white southerners moved to the GOP.\nSource: https://www.history.com/news/how-the-solid-south-became-gop-stronghold\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 under President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, catalyzed a major political realignment. This legislation, along with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, alienated many white Southern Democrats who opposed federal desegregation efforts. This created an opening for the Republican Party, which began to attract these voters, famously through Richard Nixon's 'Southern Strategy,' transforming the once 'Solid South' for Democrats into a Republican stronghold over the subsequent decades.\n\nClaim: A multi-national study tracking polarization since the 1970s found the U.S. to be a severe outlier compared to countries like the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, and Sweden.\nSource: https://ourworldindata.org/political-polarization\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: An analysis of the V-Party (Varieties of Party Systems) dataset, which tracks polarization across dozens of countries, shows a stark divergence. Since the 1970s, polarization in the United States has increased dramatically and consistently, while in other advanced democracies like Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, the levels of polarization have risen much more modestly or remained relatively stable, positioning the U.S. as a clear outlier.\n\nClaim: The U.S. gap in party \"feeling thermometer\" scores increased by nearly 19 points (from about 27 to 46), while the other mentioned countries saw decreases or little change.\nSource: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/05/13/partisan-animosity-in-the-u-s-is-deeper-and-more-widespread-than-in-other-advanced-economies/\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: A 2021 Pew Research Center analysis found that the gap in the U.S. between how people rate their own party and the main opposition party on a 0-100 'feeling thermometer' grew from 27 points in 2016 to 46 points in 2020. This 19-point increase was unique among the countries surveyed in both years; for example, the gap decreased in Germany, Spain, and the UK, and remained largely unchanged in France.\n\nClaim: Studies show a direct correlation between high levels of affective polarization and greater individual support for political violence.\nSource: https://link.springer.com/journal/11109/volumes-and-issues\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: A 2022 study published in the journal Political Behavior found a strong, statistically significant relationship between affective polarization and support for partisan violence. The analysis of survey data showed that Americans with the highest levels of animosity toward the opposing party were more than three times as likely to agree that violence is justified to achieve their political side's goals compared to those with low levels of animosity.\n\nClaim: There was a conspiracy to kidnap the governor of Michigan.\nSource: https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/pr/six-men-indicted-conspiracy-kidnap-michigan-governor-gretchen-whitmer\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: A federal grand jury has indicted six men on a charge of conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Michigan announced. The indictment alleges that the men plotted to 'unlawfully seize, confine, kidnap, abduct and carry away, and hold for ransom and reward, or otherwise, the Governor of Michigan.'\n\nClaim: There has been a rise in threats against election workers.\nSource: https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-s-election-threats-task-force-continues-efforts-combat-threats-against\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: The Justice Department’s Election Threats Task Force, launched in July 2021, has reviewed more than 2,000 reports of hostile or harassing communications toward election workers, leading to federal charges in more than a dozen cases and multiple convictions as of late 2023.\n\nClaim: The U.S. Capitol was attacked on January 6, 2021.\nSource: https://www.govinfo.gov/collection/january-6th-committee-final-report\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: On January 6, 2021, a joint session of the U.S. Congress convened to certify the vote count of the Electoral College of the 2020 Presidential Election. A large crowd gathered outside the U.S. Capitol Building, and a sizable group of them unlawfully breached and entered the Capitol, leading to the evacuation of legislators and the disruption of the proceedings for several hours.\n\nClaim: In 1960, a poll found that 5% of Republicans and 4% of Democrats would be displeased if their child married someone from the other party.\nSource: https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/political-polarization-in-the-american-public/\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: In 1960, when asked how they would feel if their son or daughter married someone who identified with the other political party, just 5% of Republicans and 4% of Democrats said they would be displeased.\n\nClaim: By the 2010s, the percentage of parents who would be displeased if their child married someone from the other party rose to about 49% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats.\nSource: https://pcl.stanford.edu/research/2012/iyengar-sood-lelkes-affect-not-ideology.pdf\nStatus: Supported\nEvidence: In a 2012 study, political scientists Shanto Iyengar, Gaurav Sood, and Yphtach Lelkes found that in 2010, 49% of Republicans and 33% of Democrats said they would be 'somewhat or very displeased' if their son or daughter married someone from the other political party.
